# Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative models

Official code for ``Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative
models''.  We use a score-based generative model to produce realistic galaxy
images.  This implementation is based off of Phil Wang's <a
href="https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch">PyTorch
version</a> which is in turn transcribed from Johnathan Ho's official
Tensorflow version <a
href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>.
