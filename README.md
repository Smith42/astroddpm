## Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative models

Official code for 'Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative
models'.  We use a score-based generative model to produce realistic galaxy
images.  This implementation is based off of Phil Wang's <a
href="https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch">PyTorch
version</a> which is in turn transcribed from Jonathan Ho's official
Tensorflow version <a
href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>. 

Below are some outputs from our model. Half of these galaxies are real and half
are generated. Check out the paper for the answer key.

The full code will be released once the review process is concluded.
