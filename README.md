## Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative models

Official code for 'Realistic galaxy simulation via score-based generative
models'.  We use a score-based generative model to produce realistic galaxy
images.  This implementation is based off of Phil Wang's <a
href="https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch">PyTorch
version</a> which is in turn transcribed from Jonathan Ho's official
Tensorflow version <a
href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>. 

Below are some outputs from our model. Half of these galaxies are real and half
are generated. Check out the paper for the answer key.

## Downloading and preprocessing the datasets

Downloading the PROBES dataset is straightforward:

    1. `cd data/probes/ && mkdir raws gals`
    2. `bash get_probes.sh`
    3. `python preprocess.py`

Downloading the SDSS dataset is a little more finicky since it is so large. Here we
speed up the process via GNU Parallel (so make sure it is installed!):

    1. `cd data/sdss/ && mkdir raws gals`
    2. `bash wrangle_csv.bash`
    3. `python preprocess.py`

## Running the code

I will be adding full instructions to train and infer with this code within the next
couple of days.

## This Galaxy/APOD Does Not Exist

More galaxies can be found <a href="http://mjjsmith.com/thisisnotagalaxy">here</a>.

We also used a DDPM to generate fake <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/">Astronomy
Picture Of the Day</a> imagery.
